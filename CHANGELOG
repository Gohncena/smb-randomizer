v0.9.8
- Added OHKO (One-Hit Knock-Out) mode. One hit will kill Mario regardless of Mario's status!
- Added (experimental) Mystery Seed mode - the randomizer's options will be randomized!
  NOTE: As of now, this mode doesn't check if chosen options are incompatible with each other, so it might crash!
- Fixed hidden 1-UPs not showing up. Now, they will always show up when level order is randomized, and/or 
  when hidden 1-UPs are included in block randomization.
- Various minor bugfixes.

  
v0.9.7
- The autoplay/demo actions that Mario does while waiting for you to press start have been disabled.
  This is to minimize any spoilers you get about the first level.
  If there is a demand for it, I can make this optional.
  Mario will jump once to let you know the game is in "demo mode".
- I've hopefully fixed despawning lifts in 1-2, but I'm not 100% sure.
- Added option to shuffle the music (so that for example all castles may get underwater music and so on).
  This option does not change anything else, and does not change flags/seedhash.
- Excluded hidden coin block in 8-4 from randomization (it is needed to complete the level normally).
- Removed option to randomize where "secondary hard mode" starts, because it was causing glitches / weirdness.

v0.9.6
- 1-2 and 4-2 can now be placed anywhere in the world layout!! (and warp zone randomization is aware of this!)
  - this is possible because I finally figured out a solution and wrote some custom code to make this work! (as in, custom NES/6502 code! Yes, I'm proud :)
- Fixed looping castles
- Toad at the end of 8-4 is no longer randomized, thus ensuring you get the princess when you win
- The hidden coin blocks in 4-2 needed to access the warp zone are no longer randomized, thus ensuring you can always get to the warp zone
- Added two "80s/outrun/vaporwave" colorschemes
- Internal changes

v0.9.5
- Added two new modes for item block randomization

- Other bug fixes
- Frontend improvements, including but not limited to:
  - If you input a seed number, the frontend will now store/remember it.
  - The button that links to the most recently created logfile now works every time!
    (Previously it only worked once, due to a bug.)
