# SMB Randomizer

A randomizer for Super Mario Bros. for the NES!

## What?

Are you tired of playing the same old levels of Super Mario Bros. over and over again? Do you want a challenge while still
playing the game you know and love? Well, look no further! This randomizer will take the original
Super Mario Bros. game for the NES and randomize certain elements of the game, kinda like shuffling
a deck of cards, providing you with a new and (hopefully) exciting and challenging experience each
time! You can choose various options for which elements you want to be randomized or shuffled, giving
you even more possibilities for variation!

_Goodbye muscle memory, hello SMB Randomizer!_
