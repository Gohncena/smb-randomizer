Process for doing randomization frontend to backend and back to frontend
************************************************************************
aka There and Back Again
1.  x User selects base ROM, MD5 is checked
2.  x Base ROM is stored in localforage
2.5 x User selects options
3.  x Options & Base ROM get sent to backend via POST request
4.  x Backend does the randomization, outputs a file
5.  x Randomized file gets uploaded / sent back to frontend 
6.  x User gets option to save file

BUGS

TODO
- Spoiler free generation (don't write a log file at all, or write one and set permissions to g-r group minus read ?)
- A way to share seeds via a link or similar (use database?)

     BUGS
BUG: FIXED? in enemies-randomize-pools Bowser can get randomized to something else!
BUG: Enemy at the end of 8-2 (on the stairs before flag) should never be a firebar
BUG: Set Y pos of Lakitu to correct value

      TODO
TODO: Option to enable hard mode from the start? If so, can we also disable world select mode?
TODO: UNUSED BYTES: lines 4350, 11058, 15044 in disasm! (also that flagball thing)
TODO: Technically, could we warp to a level that is NOT level 1 of a world?
      - No, not without code changes/additions
TODO: Useful warp zone shuffle option (all pipes take you to a higher world number)
TODO: Enemy Frenzy mode - guaranteed many more fire/bullet/cheep cheeps (generators)!!!!!
TODO: Option to leave 8-4 un-randomized.
IDEA: Is it possible to change how high Bowser jumps? to make it more difficult to just run under him. maybe around disasm line 10239
TODO: FIX Enemies stuck inside terrain!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT!!!!!
....... MAYBE JUST NOT RANDOMIZE PIRANHA PLANTS!?! that's probably the solution!
TODO: Change/randomize y pos of (some) enemies? to prevent stuck enemies
TODO: Randomize where pipes lead to?
      -- option to include 4-2 warp zone or not in shuffle - if possible.
TODO: Shuffle which pipes can be entered?
TODO: Shuffle scenery? nah... or?
TODO: Randomize Fake Bowser identities!? possible? yes, SEE LINE 11121 IN DISASM!!
TODO: Option to randomize music? (line 2790 in disasm)
      -- ROM offset 0x10f7 - 0x10fc - star power music = line 11254 in disasm
TODO: Option to disable fireworks completely? (just set all to zero)
TODO: Randomize fireworks X,Y (line 8632 in disasm)
TODO: Shuffle all coins/powerups in vanilla in one big pool, so that you in total get the same number of coins/powerups, but don't know where they are
TODO: Shuffle enemies? or keep the randomization as it is now?
TODO: Disappearing trampolines
TODO: Disappearing powerup blocks sometimes - might be related to stuff around line 5860 in disasm
TODO: Disappearing enemies/objects
      (goes for enemies and objects) "The level format is divided into "pages", so that only a small amount
      of level data is in RAM at any given time. The new page flag bit tells the game
      that the object it is set on is the first object in the page. Then, every object after that will
      appear on the same page until a new page bit is found. However,
      there are limits to this. If 3 objects are on the same x position for the same
      page, every object following that will not show up."
TODO: Option to only randomize clothes for mario/luigi, for more reasonable colors, hopefully.
TODO: Option to not randomize texts
TODO: Keep randomized texts independent of game seed? or make it an option?
TODO: Option to keep castles in vanilla order? why? just because we can?
TODO: No level shuffle + remove pipe transitions combo does not remove pipe transitions. can be fixed.
TODO: Randomize enemies in pools better! from-/to-pools
TODO: Check that all options are set to a valid value!
TODO: Disasm line  1084: change demo action data in order to not spoil first level??  offset 0x350 in rom, length 20 bytes
TODO: Disasm line  7338: maybe a better way to shuffle powerups? for mode that changes all powerups of one type to another.
TODO: Disasm line  7787: respawn points - I think. look at that
TODO: Disasm line  8370: fire bar spin speed / direction -- can be randomized!?
TODO: Disasm line  8405: cheep cheep data -- can be randomized!?
TODO: Disasm line  8698: enemy frenzy thing that checks for world 2 - should be changed??
TODO: Disasm line 11440: it's possible/easy(?) to change which enemies can be stomped and not!
TODO: Disasm line 13475: it's possible/easy(?) to change the appearance of a powerup!!!    NOPE DOESN'T WORK (sprites get weird)
TODO: Disasm line  8549: randomize fire Y positions?
TODO: A way to let individual options not change other aspects of randomization?!
      So that if you e.g. generate a new rom with the same seed, but enemy randomization turned off, all other aspects should be the same as before.
      Might be done by creating individual seeds for each aspect at the start of the program.
- Sometimes enemies "hide" behind scenery.

*********************************************************
PROBABLY DONE
*********************************************************

PROBABLY DONE: fix warp zones! warp zone pipes have strange behavior (pipes with no number take you to world -1)
      not sure if anything can be done about this, except maybe keep levels with warp zones in their vanilla world?!
      see line 1682 in disasm

*********************************************************
DONE
*********************************************************
DONE - only power ups are random (flower, star, 1 up)
DONE - add coins to that pool
DONE: Randomize Bowser's abilities? like hammers etc.?
      - we could change the code which selects bowser's abilities based on which world you're in
DONE: Randomize Bowser's hitpoints? For when you kill him with fire.
DONE: change x pos of Toad/substitute Toad? To prevent Mario getting hit by a hammer bro or something after defeating Bowser.
DONE: Option to randomize number of starting lives.
DONE: hidden warp pipe destinations
      disasm line 1759: replace routine with NOP should work? YES!
      ROM offset: 0x892 length 22 bytes
DONE: Option to only randomize world order, but leave levels normal - e.g. the first world can be vanilla world 3,
     containing vanilla 3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4, second world can be vanilla world 5, with levels 5-1 - 5-4, etc.
DONE: Warp zone gamble mode where you don't know where warp pipes lead - but 1 or 2 pipes are guaranteed to be good! yeah!
DONE: Randomize when fireworks appear? (line 10469 of disasm)

FIXED: shuffle levels with normal world order = infinite loop now (after adding 8-4 to sanity checks)







offset = 0x9fd6  (overwrites "2 PLAYER GAME")
