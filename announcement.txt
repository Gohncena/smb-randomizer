Hello Big Jon!
I'm developing a randomizer for the first Super Mario Bros game, and was wondering if you would be interested in testing it?
You can of course stream the playtesting if you want to.
Briefly about me: I discovered the randomizer gaming community during the fantastic SMB3R tournament earlier this year, and later
I got into ALTTPR. Both these have given me many many hours of fun both watching and playing. I've also been a hobby programmer for
many years, and this last year I've been studying modern web development in my spare time. I quickly decided I wanted to try to make
a randomizer of my own, and SMB seemed to be a good target for several reasons:
- I couldn't find any randomizers for SMB that did what I wanted to do
- I played this game a lot in my childhood
- It's a fairly small and simple game code-wise

The result is a web-based randomizer, and in that regard it's very much inspired by ALTTPR. I only use Linux on my computers, and didn't
want to deal with cross-compiling linux/windows/mac binaries and all that nonsense, so it made sense to make it web-based so that the
randomizer would be accessible for anyone. Also, as mentioned, I was learning web development, so it worked out for that as well.

The randomizer itself though is more inspired by Fred's SMB3 randomizer. Some things you can do:
- shuffle levels (and worlds can now have more than 4 levels if you want to)
- randomize enemies
- randomize power-up blocks
- randomize warp pipe destinations, in several ways
- for example, there's a gamble mode for warp zones, where you don't know the destinations of each pipe, but you know that 2 pipes will be useful and 1 will be bad!

There are other features as well, and more are planned!
As you know, SMB isn't a very complicated/big game, so there are limits to what things you can randomize, but I'm happy with the results so far.
The randomizer isn't finished though, and there are many areas for improvement that I'll be working on.

For now it would be very helpful if I could find some testers to play around with the randomizer and give me feedback.
One big question: is it fun to play randomized SMB? Is it interesting? Challenging? Boring?
And of course I welcome any bug reports, suggestions for improvements/changes, etc.
